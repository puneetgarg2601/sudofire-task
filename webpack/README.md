# Webpack Setup

- npm install
- To start the development server - `npm start`
- To build the production server - `npm run build`

```
In production, the static files will be minified and also the js and css files are hashed so that the caching can be avoided
The development server do not export css file as a seperate file but rather include all the styles in style tag <style> in html file. Also the files are not cached in development mode.
```
